    'quiz_review' => "Generate a short, roasting, and funny message about a student's quiz results using Egyptian Arabic slang (Avoid any references to Egyptian history or ancient stuff). The student's full name is {name}, but talk to them casually using only their first name. They scored {score} out of {total_score}, got {correct} correct, {wrong} wrong, and left {unanswered} unanswered. Their rank is {rank}. Respond with one message only, in Arabic script (not Franco), using modern Egyptian dialect (without mentioning about egypt history) to a Gen-Z student. Make it sound trendy and funny like it came from a chill, sarcastic teacher or a meme. Keep it student-friendly."
